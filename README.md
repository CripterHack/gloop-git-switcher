Gloop is a cross-platform desktop application that allows you to easily switch between multiple global Git identities (name and email) from the system tray. Designed for developers who manage personal, work, and open source project accounts separately.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Usage Example

Below are screenshots of the system tray and the user selection menu in Gloop:

| System Tray (active icon) | User Selection Menu |
|:------------------------:|:------------------:|
| ![Tray Icon](docs/captura_tray.png) | ![User Menu](docs/captura_menu.png) |

**Basic flow:**
1. Click the Gloop icon in the system tray.
2. View the current global Git user and available profiles.
3. Select a profile to instantly change the global Git user (you'll receive visual confirmation).
4. Add new profiles from the menu (name and email are validated).
5. Delete profiles from each profile's context menu (with confirmation).
6. If Git is not configured or there are errors, clear warnings will be shown.

> Gloop validates entered data and provides visual feedback for all important actions, improving experience and robustness.

## üñ•Ô∏è Building with PyInstaller

### Windows

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed src/main.py --icon=assets/gittrayapp_icon.ico --name gloop
```

### macOS

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed src/main.py --icon=assets/gittrayapp_icon.icns --name gloop
```

## üêß Linux Integration (.desktop)

Create a file `~/.local/share/applications/gloop.desktop` with the following content:

```desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Gloop
Comment=Switch between global Git identities easily
Exec=python3 /path/to/gloop/src/main.py
Icon=/path/to/gloop/assets/gloop-icon@128.png
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;Utility;
StartupNotify=true
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/gloop.desktop
```

## üß™ Automated Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` folder and cover profile management, Git interaction, and avatar fetching. Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

## ‚úÖ Future Features Checklist

* [ ] Show tooltip or quick copy of `git clone` with the active user
* [ ] Detect Git provider (GitHub, GitLab) and suggest commands
* [ ] Local configuration per folder (repo-specific mode)
* [ ] Integration with SSH keys and `.ssh/config`
* [ ] User change and activity history
* [ ] Full interface for profile management
* [ ] Multilanguage translation

## üü¢ Current Development Status

- MVP 0: ‚úÖ Completed (bootstrap, structure, CI, basic documentation)
- MVP 1: ‚úÖ Completed (core functionality, data validation, visual feedback, automated tests, profile deletion option, robustness validated by tests)
- MVP 2: ‚¨ú In progress (UX improvements, multiplatform support, advanced error messages)

> All MVP 1 features have been implemented and automatically validated by unit tests. The data validation and visual feedback system meets the robustness and user experience standards defined in the strategic guide.
